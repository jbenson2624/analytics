Fertility	R Documentation
Fertility and Women's Labor Supply
Description
Cross-section data from the 1980 US Census on married women aged 21–35 with two or more children.

Usage
data("Fertility")
data("Fertility2")
Format
A data frame containing 254,654 (and 30,000, respectively) observations on 8 variables.

morekids
factor. Does the mother have more than 2 children?

gender1
factor indicating gender of first child.

gender2
factor indicating gender of second child.

age
age of mother at census.

afam
factor. Is the mother African-American?

hispanic
factor. Is the mother Hispanic?

other
factor. Is the mother's ethnicity neither African-American nor Hispanic, nor Caucasian? (see below)

work
number of weeks in which the mother worked in 1979.

Details
Fertility2 is a random subset of Fertility with 30,000 observations.

There are conflicts in the ethnicity coding (see also examples). Hence, it was not possible to create a single factor and the original three indicator variables have been retained.

Not all variables from Angrist and Evans (1998) have been included.

Examples
data("Fertility2")

## conflicts in ethnicity coding
ftable(xtabs(~ afam + hispanic + other, data = Fertility2))

## create convenience variables
Fertility2$mkids <- with(Fertility2, as.numeric(morekids) - 1)
Fertility2$samegender <- with(Fertility2, factor(gender1 == gender2))
Fertility2$twoboys <- with(Fertility2, factor(gender1 == "male" & gender2 == "male"))
Fertility2$twogirls <- with(Fertility2, factor(gender1 == "female" & gender2 == "female"))

## similar to Angrist and Evans, p. 462
fm1 <- lm(mkids ~ samegender, data = Fertility2)
summary(fm1)

fm2 <- lm(mkids ~ gender1 + gender2 + samegender + age + afam + hispanic + other, data = Fertility2)
summary(fm2)

fm3 <- lm(mkids ~ gender1 + twoboys + twogirls + age + afam + hispanic + other, data = Fertility2)
summary(fm3)
